notes and questions:
1. non functional requirements.
i changed the format, no big deal, but there are a lot of samples that i can across in the coursepack that i think we can bs into ours.  simple things like usability, help...

2.ASLS_organization.pdf
i think that you may have this working right, because winedit doesn't even give me an error on it.  the only thing is that the .pdf file on my computer is messed up, so i think it's showing, but the pdf file is just nothing.  maybe??

3.milestones
i added the milestones we discussed in one of the meetings (the minutes are in cvs now, by the way, incase you need to refer to them), but there didn't seem to be enough, so i added some stuff about iterations.  don't know if these are ok, just thought they might bind us to something.  check em out.
