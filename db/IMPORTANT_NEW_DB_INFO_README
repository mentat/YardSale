Guys,

Please make sure to use the MySQL server on Rau whenever possible
especially when testing these new add functions.

I just realized that on a normal Gentoo install of MySQL the 
default table type is MyISAM not InnoDB. This will allow
broken references to occur and never throw an error. I worked
hard to setup InnoDB on rau to alleviate this and local installs
of MySQL will cause broken referential integrity constraints
unless you deliberately used InnoDB compile options on the 
install.

Cheers,
Adam
