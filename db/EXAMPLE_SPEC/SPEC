Using the sql script included in this directory create a frontend to add users 
to the database. The main focus is to find the easiest method of interfacing 
with the database as possible. A good thing to do would be to make functions
for the following operations to allow the best code reusability.

-Open A Database connection
	Accept a database connection url as the argument
	Accept a db username and password
	Return true if we get one 
	Return false if we don't

-Execute a query
	Accept a query string as an argument
	Execute the query, return the resultset  (In JDBC this is already
	  written, C++ may  have  a similar function)

-Close db Connection
	Accept a db connection url or object
	Return true if successful  
	Return false if not

The GUI should take the following input 
	-Social Security Number (11 Chars Max)
	-First Name
	-Middle Name
	-Last Name
	-Phone number
	-House Number
	-Street Name
	-City
	-State
	-Zip

	All values  for the database that are of type varchar() have a limit 
	placed on size. If you look at the .sql script you can find them.

Another good section would be a database browser using a listview. Basically 
executing the included SELECT statement, storing the resultset and printing 
it to the listview would be some highly reusable code as well.

A nice feature would also be to select a member of the list view and populate 
the above fields in the other gui with them. 

Do not feel the need to "UPDATE" users. That code is only slightly different
and would likely be a waste of time to debug for now.

Please check all working code into this directory. If you have questions about
the table structure or any Database related things respond to  

yardsale-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Thanks.
