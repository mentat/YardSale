You need automake 1.6 and autoconf 2.57

Run ./autogen.sh to configure the project and then:
make

The binary will be in src/

If you accidently modify something get a clean copy with:

cvs update -C


If you have a problem email jesse

-From john (jwlamb@ncsu.edu):

In order for the wxDb classes to work, you need to have wxWindows
installed and compiled with odbc support, a la 
	./configure --with-odbc --prefix=/usr
(You may also want to add --with-gl, since opengl kicks ass.)  Also,
you need to have the "unixODBC" and "MyODBC" packages installed.
In order to access a specific DB, you have to configure a ~/.odbc.ini
or /etc/odbc.ini such as the one outlined in
http://www.wxwindows.org/manuals/2.4.2/wx497.htm#wxodbcconfiguringyoursystem

That ought to do it for now.
